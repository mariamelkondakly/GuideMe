# Guide Me – Route Finder

This project is a city route-finding desktop application developed for the Data Structures course at Ain Shams University. It allows users to explore city connections and visualize different traversal paths using classical graph search algorithms.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Guide Me** simulates a basic path-finding tool where cities are treated as nodes and direct routes as edges. It supports:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** traversal  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** traversal  

All data structures and logic were implemented using C++ Standard Template Library (STL), with a user-friendly GUI built using Qt.

## 🔍 Features

### 📌 Graph-Based Path Finding
- Cities are stored using **unordered maps** for fast access and traversal.
- Users can select starting points to visualize either **DFS** or **BFS** traversals.
- The traversed path is displayed in real-time through the UI.

### 🎨 UI/UX Design
- Designed and prototyped with **Figma** to ensure intuitive navigation.
- Developed with **Qt Widgets** for a responsive and interactive GUI.
- Clear city nodes, labeled routes, and interactive traversal options.

### ⚙️ Algorithm Implementation
- **DFS**: implemented using a stack (recursive and iterative versions tested).
- **BFS**: implemented using a queue for level-order exploration.
- Handles disconnected graphs and input validation.
